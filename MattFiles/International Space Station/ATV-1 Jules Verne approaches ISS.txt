Backdropped by the blackness of space and the airglow of Earth's horizon, the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle - 1 (ATV-1) Jules Verne, approaches the International Space Station on Monday, March 31, 2008, for its &quot;Demo Day 2&quot; practice maneuvers. It moved to within 36 feet of the Zvezda Service Module in a rehearsal for docking.  Jules Verne was launched on March 8 (eastern time) from the Kourou Space Center on an Ariane V launch vehicle.  After &quot;Demo Day&quot; tests of the automated navigation and collision avoidance systems of this first ATV, Jules Verne docked with the ISS on April 3, 2008.
