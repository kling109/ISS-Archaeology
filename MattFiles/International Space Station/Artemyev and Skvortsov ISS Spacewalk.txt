Russian cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev and Alexander Skvortsov (out of frame), both Expedition 40 flight engineers, attired in Russian Orlan spacesuits, participate in an extravehicular activity (EVA) in support of science and maintenance on the International Space Station. During the five-hour, 11-minute spacewalk, Artemyev and Skvortsov deployed a small science satellite, retrieved and installed experiment packages and inspected components on the exterior of the orbital laboratory. Solar array wings on the &quot;Georges Lemaitre&quot; Automated Transfer Vehicle-5 (ATV-5) docked to the Zvezda Service Module are visible in the background.
