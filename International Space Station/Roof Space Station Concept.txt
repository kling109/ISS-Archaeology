This is the Johnson Space Center's 1984 &quot;roof&quot; concept for a space station. The &quot;roof&quot; was covered with solar array cells, that were to generate about 120 kilowatts of electricity. Within the V-shaped beams there would be five modules for living, laboratory space, and external areas for instruments and other facilities.
