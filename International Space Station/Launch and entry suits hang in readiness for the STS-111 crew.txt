Launch and entry suits hang in readiness for the STS-111 crew. Launch was on June 5, 2002, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. STS-111 was the second Utilization Flight to the International Space Station, carrying the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module Leonardo, the Mobile Base System (MBS), and a replacement wrist/roll joint for the Canadarm 2. Also onboard Space Shuttle Endeavour was the Expedition 5 crew who replaced Expedition 4 on board the Station. The MBS was installed on the Mobile Transporter to complete the Canadian Mobile Servicing System, or MSS. The mechanical arm then had the capability to &quot;inchworm&quot; from the U.S. Lab Destiny to the MSS and travel along the truss to work sites. Expedition 4 crew members returned to Earth with the STS-111 crew on Endeavour
